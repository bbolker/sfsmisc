As already for  sfsmisc 1.0-26 and later:
When checking (with --as-cran)  I get 2  NOTE s  which I don't think are
easy to workaround and should be acceptable here :

NOTES:
------
1)
  * checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... NOTE
  Maintainer: ‘Martin Maechler <maechler@stat.math.ethz.ch>’

  The Title field should be in title case, current version then in title case:
  ‘Utilities from "Seminar fuer Statistik" ETH Zurich’
  ‘Utilities from "Seminar Fuer Statistik" ETH Zurich’

2)
  Found the following calls to attach():
  File ‘sfsmisc/R/sourceAttach.R’:
    attach(ENV, pos = pos, name = name, warn.conflicts = warn.conflicts)
  See section ‘Good practice’ in ‘?attach’.

EXPLANATIONS:
------------

1) English capitalization would look *very wrong* for this German language part

2) sourceAttach() is a utility which uses source() and does not
  do that into the globalenv but rather into a new position in the
  search() path, something which can well be desirable compared
  to the default source()ing into globalenv.
