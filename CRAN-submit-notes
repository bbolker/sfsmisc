Submitter's comment: As already since  sfsmisc 1.0-25 :
when checking (with --as-cran)  I get NOTE  which is a false positive :

NOTE:
----

  Found the following calls to attach():
  File ‘sfsmisc/R/sourceAttach.R’:

   attach(ENV, pos = pos, name = name, warn.conflicts = warn.conflicts)

  See section ‘Good practice’ in ‘?attach’.

EXPLANATION:
------------

  sourceAttach() is a utility which uses source() and does not do that into
  the globalenv but rather into a new position in the search() path,
  something which can well desirable compared to the default source()ing
  into globalenv.
